# FP&A Portfolio — Decision-Grade Finance Systems (Ralph Patrick Divina)

A production-ready **FP&A portfolio** built as interactive, executive-friendly modules (not screenshots, not static spreadsheets).

This repo showcases how I think and build as a finance operator: **drivers → models → KPIs → scenarios → decision outputs**.

---

## What this is

Think of this like a “finance playground” for CEOs/CFOs/FP&A Leads:

- You can **change assumptions**
- run **Base / Upside / Downside**
- see **KPIs + charts update instantly**
- get **decision-focused outputs** (not just numbers)

Built to prove:
- FP&A system thinking
- commercial + operating finance fluency
- modeling architecture (not spreadsheet chaos)
- narrative + decision-making outputs

## What makes this “CFO-grade”

Most portfolios show Excel. This behaves like internal finance software:

- **Driver-based modeling** (not manual cell pushing)
- **Scenario logic** (Base/Upside/Downside)
- **Decision outputs** (e.g., “raise / cut burn / slow growth” style conclusions inside modules)
- **Executive UX** (fast, clear, readable)

---

## Tech Stack

- HTML + CSS
- Vanilla JavaScript
- Chart.js (charts)
- PapaParse (CSV parsing)

No frameworks. Fast to load. Easy to review. Runs anywhere.

## Who this is for

If you’re hiring for any of these, this repo is meant to be a direct proof of work:

- FP&A / Finance Business Partner
- Finance Ops / Finance Lead
- Strategic Finance
- CFO-style IC (systems + insights + execution)

---

## Roadmap (next upgrades)

Ideas I can build next (depending on role/company needs):
- sensitivity engine (1-click tornado / driver ranking)
- board-slide export (auto “Board Summary” PDF)
- multi-entity consolidation layer
- import templates per industry (standardized CSV schemas)
- audit trail of assumption changes (“who changed what”)
