# FP&A Simulator  
### Industry-Adaptive Financial Planning & Scenario Modeling

An interactive finance system demonstrating how different business models generate revenue, incur costs, and react to operational and risk drivers.

Built for CFOs, FP&A teams, hiring managers, and operators.

---

## 🚀 What This Is

This is a **live, configurable FP&A environment**.

Users can:

- switch industries  
- adjust drivers & constraints  
- compare Base / Upside / Downside  
- upload their own datasets  
- generate realistic random data  

…and immediately see the impact across KPIs, forecasts, and charts.

No static spreadsheets.  
No screenshots pretending to be systems.  
Everything recalculates in real time.

## 🧠 Why This Exists

Finance is not about reporting history.

It is about understanding:

- how the business makes money  
- what variables matter  
- where risk hides  
- what happens when assumptions change  

This simulator proves capability in those areas.
