# FP&A Portfolio Website (GitHub Pages)

A minimalist, executive-friendly FP&A portfolio site:
- Apple/consulting-inspired hierarchy and whitespace
- Modular card-based layout
- Lightweight JS (mobile nav + subtle reveal)
- Designed for desktop/laptop viewing

## Quick Start (local)
Just open `index.html` in your browser.

## GitHub Pages Setup
1. Push this folder to your repo (e.g., `finance-portfolio`)
2. Go to **Repo Settings → Pages**
3. Under **Build and deployment**:
   - Source: **Deploy from a branch**
   - Branch: `main` (or `master`) and `/ (root)`
4. Save. Your site will be at:
   `https://<username>.github.io/<repo>/`

## Customize
Update these in `index.html`:
- GitHub link: `https://github.com/your-username`
- LinkedIn link: `https://www.linkedin.com/in/your-profile`
- Email: `mailto:you@email.com`

To link each project to real pages later:
- Replace `href="#"` with your project page paths (e.g., `/projects/core-model/`)
- Or link directly to GitHub folders.

## Suggested project structure (later)
Create folders like:
- `/projects/unified-fpa-core-model/`
- `/projects/commercial-sales-finance/`
- `/projects/unit-economics/`
- `/projects/indirect-cost-headcount/`
- `/projects/ops-spend-analytics/`

Each can be its own mini “product page” using the same design language.
